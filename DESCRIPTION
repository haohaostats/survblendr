Description: Adaptive spline-weighted blended survival extrapolation on the cumulative hazard scale. Combines a piecewise-exponential (Cox-type) model with a first-order random-walk (RW1) prior fitted via INLA (observation side) and an anchor-identified Gompertz tail (external side). The time-varying weight is obtained by fitting a monotone P-spline (SCAM) to the log-cumulative-hazard contrast and mapped through a logistic link; a temperature parameter is selected to guarantee nonnegative blended hazards on a grid. Includes diagnostics, plots, and summary metrics for simulation and real-world use.
